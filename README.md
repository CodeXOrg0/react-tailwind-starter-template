# React-tailwind-starter-template

This template is a simple and minimalistic boilerplate that allows you to get started right there and then with a React.js project hooked up with the Tailwind CSS package and configurations. You can learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) easily by looking up the documentation here. Use this as a public template that you can create a new repo from, after which you can **clone** your personal repo to your local computer and work with it.

Leave a star if you enjoy the template !
