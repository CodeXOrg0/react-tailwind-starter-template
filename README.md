# React-tailwind-starter-template

This template is a simple and minimalistic boilerplate that allows you to get started right there and then with a React.js project hooked up with the Tailwind CSS package and configurations. You can learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) easily by looking up the documentation here. Use this as a public template that you can create a new repo from, after which you can **clone** your personal repo to your local computer and work with it.

## Steps
1. Create a new repository using this as the template
2. Clone the repository from your terminal with `gh repo clone [YOUR URL]` or download the zip file
3. After cloning, head into the terminal of your folder, and use `npm i` to install all the necessary libraries required
4. Use `npm start` to look at the localhost webpage
5. Edit `tailwind.config.js` as you want to speed up and simplify your tailwind styling
